        <p>Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix television 
            show Stranger Things, portrayed by Joe Keery. While starting out as 
            a typical unlikable jock, Steve has grown into a more protecting and 
            caring character as the show has progressed, a development that has 
            received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led 
            to him becoming one of the show’s most beloved and enduring 
            characters.[1] Initially a part of the recurring cast, Keery was 
            promoted to the main cast in the second season. Steve is a side 
            antagonist turned protagonist at the end of season 1, and one of 
            the main protagonists of season 2, season 3, and season 4.</p>
